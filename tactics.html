    <h2>Tactics</h2>

    <h3>Discovered Attacks</h3>

    <p>
        A discovered attack happens when a friendly piece that was blocking another friendly piece moves away and allows the other piece to attack an enemy piece.
        Discovered attacks are especially dangerous because the moved piece can pose another threat and most times, the threatened player cannot defend both threats at once.
        When a piece moves away and check is delivered, it is called a discovered check.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the example above, the white knight captures the black bishop, but in the process, opens an attack from the rook to the queen. 
        Despite the knight being under attack, Black cannot recapture if he/she does not want to lose his/her queen. 
    </p>

    <h3>Forks</h3>

    <p>
        A fork happens when a piece attacks two or more enemy pieces simultaneously.
        Given that the opponent cannot address both threats at once, they must surrender one of those pieces.
        However, the opponent also can use the tactic of a zwischenzug to counter a fork. 
        Zwischenzug means creating another threat that is even more dangerous so it forces the opponent to stop their attack and address that attack.
        Howevver, forks that check a king are especially frutious as they force the opponent to move their king out of check and stops any possible ideas of zwischenzugs.

    <p>
        In the example above, the black knight moves and attacks both of White's rooks. 
        Black cannot defend against both threats and must give up one of the rooks in exchange for a knight, a positive exchange for Black given that a rook is worth two more points than a knight.
    </p>

    <h3>Pins</h3>

    <p>
        A pin happens when a piece prevents an enemy piece from moving because doing so would expose a more valuable piece than the pinning piece.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the example above, there are actually two pins.
        The black bishop pins the rook as moving that rook would expose the queen. 
        Black, however, counters this pin by pinning the bishop to the king, and now the bishop cannot capture as doing so would expose the king to check.
