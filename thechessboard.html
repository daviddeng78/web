<p>The chessboard is an 8x8 board whose squares alternate between white and black.
    The rows of a chessboard are referred to as ranks and are numbered from 1 - 8.
    The columns of a chessbaord are referred to as files are lettered from A - H.
    Squares are referred to as a combination of the file and the rank, with the former being first.
    For example, the square that is on the D file and on the 4th rank is referred to as D4.
    There are also 32 pieces, 16 white and 16 black, on the chessboard in the beginning position, their purpose and their location will be described below. 
    White pieces are on the bottom while their black counterparts are on the top.
</p>

<h3>Pieces</h3>

<h4>Pawn</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Chess_piece_-_White_pawn.JPG" alt="Pawn" width="128" height="200">

<p>The pawn is the most numerous piece on the chessboard. 
    There are 16 of them in total, half of which are white and half of which are black. 
    They are placed along the 2nd and the 7th rank.
    At their starting positions, pawns have the limited option of moving up two squares. 
    However, this option disappears after the pawn has moved up one square or has already used this option and that pawn can only move up one square or capture from then on.
    Pawns capture by moving to any squares diagonally in front of them.
</p>

<p>
    Pawns have another very special move though. Capturing en passant. 
    This means that if your pawn is horizontally adjacent to an enemy pawn that has been moved two spaces, you may capture it "diagonally" despite it not being diagonal of the pawn. This possibility only lasts for one move though and it is not possible thereafter.
    For example, let's say there's a pawn on D2. 
    It is moved two spaces up to D4. 
    However, there is an enemy pawn on C4. 
    That pawn may choose to capture en passant and will land on C3 after said capture. 
</p>

<h4>Bishop</h4>

<p>
    The bishop is placed on C1 F1 C8 and F8 at the beginning.
    They can move diagonally as many spaces as they want as long as they are not obstructed by a friendly piece or an enemy piece.
</p>

<h4>Knight</h4>

<p>
    The knight is placed on B1 G1 B8 and G8 at the beginning.
    The knight has a very different way of moving compared to the other pieces. 
    It moves in a L shape (two squares in one direction, and then one space to the right or left of that square or vice versa), and unlike all other pieces, it is not obstructed by any pieces in its way. 
    The only square that needs to be empty is the one which the knight lands on, it "hops" over all the squares in between so regardless of the possibility that there might be pieces, whether friendly or enemy, on the squares that form the L, it can still move to its destination, given that it is empty.
</p>

<h4>Rook</h4>

<p>
    The rook is placed on A1 H1 A8 and H8 at the beginning. 
    The rook can move vertically and horizontally for as many spaces as it wants as long as there is no piece obstructing its way. 
</p>

<h4>Queen</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Chess_piece_-_White_queen.jpg" alt="Queen" width="128" height="200">

<p>
    The queen is placed on D1 and D8 at the beginning. 
    It is the most powerful piece in the game as it can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally as many spaces as it wants as long as there are no pieces obstructing it. 
</p>

<h4>King</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Chess_piece_-_White_king.jpg" alt="King" width="128" height="200">


<p>
    The king is placed on E1 and E8 at the beginning.
    It has the omnidirectional power of the queen but it can only move one space at a time.
</p>

<h3>Piece Values</h3>

<div class="values">
    <ul>
        <li>Pawn = 1</li>
        <li>Knight = 3</li>
        <li>Bishop = 3</li>
        <li>Rook = 5</li>
        <li>Queen = 9</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    It is important to note that although knights and bishops are worth the same, each of them pose an advantage over the other in different situations.
    Typically, knights are better when there are multiple pieces on the board as it can "hop" over the obstructing pieces and help out more. 
    Bishops, on the other hand, are better when there are less pieces on the board as it can cover more ground in a move.
    Of course, this is all just theory and does not account for all cases.
