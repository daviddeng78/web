<p>The chessboard is an 8x8 board whose squares alternate between white and black.
    The rows of a chessboard are referred to as ranks and are numbered from 1 - 8.
    The columns of a chessbaord are referred to as files are lettered from A - H.
    Squares are referred to as a combination of the file and the rank, with the former being first.
    For example, the square that is on the D file and on the 4th rank is referred to as D4.
    There are also 32 pieces, 16 white and 16 black, on the chessboard in the beginning position, their purpose and their location will be described below. 
    White pieces are on the bottom while their black counterparts are on the top.
</p>

<h3>Pieces</h3>

<h4>Pawn</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Chess_piece_-_White_pawn.JPG" alt="Pawn" width="128" height="200">

<p>The pawn is the most numerous piece on the chessboard. 
    There are 16 of them in total, half of which are white and half of which are black. 
    They are placed along the 2nd and the 7th rank.
    At their starting positions, pawns have the limited option of moving up two squares. 
    However, this option disappears after the pawn has moved up one square or has already used this option and that pawn can only move up one square or capture from then on.
    Pawns capture by moving to any squares diagonally in front of them.
</p>

<p>
    Pawns have another very special move though. Capturing en passant. 
    This means that if your pawn is horizontally adjacent to an enemy pawn that has been moved two spaces, you may capture it "diagonally" despite it not being diagonal of the pawn. This possibility only lasts for one move though and it is not possible thereafter.
    For example, let's say there's a pawn on D2. 
    It is moved two spaces up to D4. 
    However, there is an enemy pawn on C4. 
    That pawn may choose to capture en passant and will land on C3 after said capture. 
</p>

<h4>Bishop</h4>


<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Chess_piece_-_White_bishop.JPG" alt="Bishop" width="128" height="200">


<p>
    The bishop is placed on C1 F1 C8 and F8 at the beginning.
    They can move diagonally as many spaces as they want as long as they are not obstructed by a friendly piece or an enemy piece.
</p>

<h4>Knight</h4>


<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Chess_piece_-_White_knight.JPG" alt="Knight" width="128" height="200">

<p>
    The knight is placed on B1 G1 B8 and G8 at the beginning.
    The knight has a very different way of moving compared to the other pieces. 
    It moves in a L shape (two squares in one direction, and then one space to the right or left of that square or vice versa), and unlike all other pieces, it is not obstructed by any pieces in its way. 
    The only square that needs to be empty is the one which the knight lands on, it "hops" over all the squares in between so regardless of the possibility that there might be pieces, whether friendly or enemy, on the squares that form the L, it can still move to its destination, given that it is empty.
</p>

<h4>Rook</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Chess_piece_-_White_rook.JPG" alt="Rook" width="128" height="200">

<p>
    The rook is placed on A1 H1 A8 and H8 at the beginning. 
    The rook can move vertically and horizontally for as many spaces as it wants as long as there is no piece obstructing its way. 
</p>

<h4>Queen</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Chess_piece_-_White_queen.jpg" alt="Queen" width="128" height="200">

<p>
    The queen is placed on D1 and D8 at the beginning. 
    It is the most powerful piece in the game as it can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally as many spaces as it wants as long as there are no pieces obstructing it. 
</p>

<h4>King</h4>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Chess_piece_-_White_king.jpg" alt="King" width="128" height="200">


<p>
    The king is placed on E1 and E8 at the beginning.
    It has the omnidirectional power of the queen but it can only move one space at a time.
</p>

<h3>Piece Values</h3>

<div class="values">
    <ul>
        <li>Pawn = 1</li>
        <li>Knight = 3</li>
        <li>Bishop = 3</li>
        <li>Rook = 5</li>
        <li>Queen = 9</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    It is important to note that although knights and bishops are worth the same, each of them pose an advantage over the other in different situations.
    Typically, knights are better when there are multiple pieces on the board as it can "hop" over the obstructing pieces and help out more. 
    Bishops, on the other hand, are better when there are less pieces on the board as it can cover more ground in a move.
    Of course, this is all just theory and does not account for all cases.

<h2>Openings</h2>

<p>Openings are extremely important in chess. 
    By starting off with a good position, you allow your other pieces to start moving and reach squares where they are much more useful.
    Openings rely on one motive and that is for control of the center. 
    By controlling the center, you allow your pieces to conquer these middle squares, where they can be the most useful, as well as expand towards either side of the board.
    White, who goes first in chess, will often move their central pawns (the d and e pawns) to assert control of the center and Black has many different responses, each with a different playstyle as well as a different motive. 
    Let's dive into a few of the most common ones.
</p>

<h3>Ruy Lopez Opening</h3>

<img src="https://cdn1.ichess.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ruy-Lopez-593x600.jpg" alt="Ruy Lopez" width="200" height="200">

<p>
    The Ruy Lopez opening is one of the most common openings. 
    The point is for White to pressure the pawn on E5 and push other pawns to the center to establish a strong presence there early on, but it is very vague and can transpose to many variations depending on how Black responds.
</p>

<h3>Sicilian Defense</h3>

<img src="https://www.chessable.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sicilian-Defense-300x300.png" alt="Sicilian Defense" width="200" height="200">

<p>
    The Sicilian Defense is a very popular opening. 
    Black supports his fight for the center by pushing his C pawn, blocking White from pushing D4 without losing one of his central pawns (the D and E pawns). 
</p>

<h3>Queen's Gambit</h3>

<img src="https://374999-1254560-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/QueensGambit-e1346610053936.jpg" alt="Queen's Gambit" width="200" height="200">

<p>
    The Queen's Gambit is an extremely old opening and was recently even more popularized through the 2020 Netflix show "The Queen's Gambit". 
    In this opening, White seems to offer a free pawn in order to dislodge one of Black's central pawns and gain more control of the center but White will eventually regain it. 
</p>

<p>
    As you can see, many of the popular openings revolve around the control of the center and despite White going first, Black always has a variety of defenses to choose from.

<h2>Tactics</h2>

<h3>Discovered Attacks</h3>

<p>
    A discovered attack happens when a friendly piece that was blocking another friendly piece moves away and allows the other piece to attack an enemy piece.
    Discovered attacks are especially dangerous because the moved piece can pose another threat and most times, the threatened player cannot defend both threats at once.
    When a piece moves away and check is delivered, it is called a discovered check.
</p>

<img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pdrpnht/phpZfFnE9.gif" alt="Discovered Attack" width="200" height="200">

<p>
    In the example above, the white knight captures the black bishop, but in the process, opens an attack from the rook to the queen. 
    Despite the knight being under attack, Black cannot recapture if he/she does not want to lose his/her queen. 
</p>

<h3>Forks</h3>

<p>
    A fork happens when a piece attacks two or more enemy pieces simultaneously.
    Given that the opponent cannot address both threats at once, they must surrender one of those pieces.
    However, the opponent also can use the tactic of a zwischenzug to counter a fork. 
    Zwischenzug means creating another threat that is even more dangerous so it forces the opponent to stop their attack and address that attack.
    Howevver, forks that check a king are especially frutious as they force the opponent to move their king out of check and stops any possible ideas of zwischenzugs.
</p>

<img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pdrpnht/phpnkaCDm.gif" alt="Forks" width="200" height="200">

<p>
    In the example above, the black knight moves and attacks both of White's rooks. 
    Black cannot defend against both threats and must give up one of the rooks in exchange for a knight, a positive exchange for Black given that a rook is worth two more points than a knight.
</p>

<h3>Pins</h3>

<p>
    A pin happens when a piece prevents an enemy piece from moving because doing so would expose a more valuable piece than the pinning piece.
</p>

<img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pdrpnht/phpTecbiB.gif" alt="Pins" width="200" height="200">

<p>
    In the example above, there are actually two pins.
    The black bishop pins the rook as moving that rook would expose the queen. 
    Black, however, counters this pin by pinning the bishop to the king, and now the bishop cannot capture as doing so would expose the king to check.
