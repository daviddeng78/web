<p>Openings are extremely important in chess. 
    By starting off with a good position, you allow your other pieces to start moving and reach squares where they are much more useful.
    Openings rely on one motive and that is for control of the center. 
    By controlling the center, you allow your pieces to conquer these middle squares, where they can be the most useful, as well as expand towards either side of the board.
    White, who goes first in chess, will often move their central pawns (the d and e pawns) to assert control of the center and Black has many different responses, each with a different playstyle as well as a different motive. 
    Let's dive into a few of the most common ones.

<h3>Ruy Lopez Opening</h3>

<p>
    The Ruy Lopez opening is one of the most common openings. 
    The point is for White to pressure the pawn on E5 and push other pawns to the center to establish a strong presence there early on, but it is very vague and can transpose to many variations depending on how Black responds.

<h3>Sicilian Defense</h3>

<p>
    The Sicilian Defense is a very popular opening. 
    Black supports his fight for the center by pushing his C pawn, blocking White from pushing D4 without losing one of his central pawns (the D and E pawns).

<h3>Queen's Gambit</h3>

<p>
    The Queen's Gambit is an extremely old opening and was recently even more popularized through the 2020 Netflix show "The Queen's Gambit". 
    In this opening, White seems to offer a free pawn in order to dislodge one of Black's central pawns and gain more control of the center but White will eventually regain it.

<p>
    As you can see, many of the popular openings revolve around the control of the center and despite White going first, Black always has a variety of defenses to choose from.
